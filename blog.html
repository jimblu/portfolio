          As I said in my previous post, the main goal was to have somewhere to share my thoughts as soon as possible. I didnâ€™t want to wait 3 months before I was able to post my first post. So I decided to keep things simple on the technical side as well. Here are the steps I took to have my personal website

1- Design and specs
When it comes to development, everything is so much easier when features have been thought through before starting coding. Even for personal projects, itâ€™s super important to keep that in mind. As it comes for features, I chose to make the most out of basic functionnalities. With that in mind I defined the pages I wanted, I can always develop more features later.

I made a simple design on Figma. Figma is a Sketch-like application. You can design your project super easily, and for free !

2- Coding
Many people around me are super hyped with GatsbyJS, and I already love coding in React / NodeJS. One of the advantages of Gatsby is it takes React code, and makes static pages from it, which makes your website really fast. Plus, the community around Gatsby is great. I also knew there was a plugin that allows to write pages in MD and automatically converts it in HTML. My choice was simple ðŸ¤©

I followed Jean Elieâ€™s tutorial whoâ€™s my ex colleague at PayFit. The Gatsby official documentation is really good. Iâ€™d add some more details to Jean-Elieâ€™s tutorial: Google Analytics is already in the blog starter, so all you have to worry about is to set your ID in gatsby-config.js
